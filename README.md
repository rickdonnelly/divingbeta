## divingbeta | Experiences and opinions instilled by my love of scuba diving

I plan to spin up a website in [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) devoted to commentaries and reviews related to recreational and technical scuba diving. Many of my reviews have evolved from long, tortured email conversations with diving buddies on various topics and products. We indulged in them because we're probably too picky about gear than anyone ought to be. I'm also a big jaded with the reviews published in mainstream diving periodicals. They often appear to be assemblies of press releases, whilst in other cases they're focused on recreational divers. Too many seemed to be based on unboxing the products rather than months of regular use. Hence, this collection of articles:

+ [My search for the perfect semidry wetsuit]()
+ [Comparison of fleece versus Thinsulate drysuit undergarments]()

This is very much a work in progress. There are no places to post comments, a shortcoming that moving to WordPress will eventually overcome. In the meantime, please click `Issues` in the menu bar and post your comments there.
